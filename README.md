# QueueClearer (name subject to change)

This bot was created to manage the office hours queue for CS 3240 @ UVA. Standard practice when holding office hours is that students will send a message describing their problem into a text channel and join a waiting room voice channel while TAs work down the queue addressing issues. The issue is that the queue tends to fill up during busy times, and while TAs are supposed to delete messages to clean it up, when things get hectic this doesn't always happen. I decided there had to be a better way, so I created this bot to automate that process.

## How it works

When students come to office hours, we expect this pattern of behavior:
- Student sends message in text channel and joins queue waiting room, more or less at the same time
- TA/professor pulls student out of the waiting room into their own channel
- After receiving help, the student leaves, disconnecting from all voice channels.

Using Discord's API, the bot is capable of detecting when students send messages and move in/out of voice channels. It uses this information to more or less track student activity during office hours with this logic:
- When a student sends a message, both the message and their ID is stored. At this point, it's assumed that they are also joining the waiting room voice channel. 
- Following up on this assumption, the bot assumes that the next time the student moves between channels, they are being moved by an instructor to a help channel. At this point, the bot will put a üëç reaction on their message(s) in the queue to signal to the other instructors that the student is being helped.
- When a student disconnects from all voice channels entirely, the bot assumes that their issue is solved and deletes their message(s) from the queue.

Critically, for the bot to work, the students cannot disconnect from any voice channel (moving between channels is fine) from the moment they enter their message. or it will be deleted.

## Deployment

The deployment of the bot used for CS 3240 will be on Heroku, just running `main.py` indefinitely. It has these config vars:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord API token; required for the bot to work at all. The corresponding bot must also be added to the class server with the "Manage Messages" and "Add Reactions" permissions for full functionality. 
- `OH_QUEUE_CHANNEL`: The name of the channel used for the office hours queue. Defaults to the name used by the CS 3240 server if not specified.
- `INSTRUCTOR_ROLES`: The names of roles held by instructors (professors, TAs) on the server, whose messages in the queue shouldn't be automatically deleted. Defaults to the roles used by the CS 3240 server if not specified.
